# Arr

NixOS LXC on Cube running the media automation stack. The container is
`module "arr"` in `terraform/cube-arr.tf`, and the apps are `modules/arr`,
one file per app.

## How the apps find each other

The apps keep their connections to each other (download clients, Prowlarr's
app sync, Seerr's servers) in their own databases, as the host's LAN address
and each app's port. Nix can't declare any of that, so moving or rebuilding
the host has to keep:

- **The address.** It's a fixed DHCP reservation for the container's MAC.
- **The ports.** Sonarr Anime is a second Sonarr on its own port, not a
  remapped container port.
- **The API keys.** Sonarr, Sonarr Anime, Radarr, Prowlarr and SABnzbd get
  theirs from agenix. Seerr, Tautulli, Maintainerr and Shelfarr keep theirs in
  their data folders, and Deluge's web password (what Sonarr and Radarr log in
  with) is in `web.conf`.

## Media

The `unraid-media` pool is bind-mounted at `/mnt/media`, the same path as
Plex, and the apps store their paths under it. Unraid's NFS export squashes
every user to `nobody:users`, so the services run as their normal NixOS users
and files still land as 99:100.

## Containers

Maintainerr, Shelfarr and Calibre-Web-Automated have no NixOS module, so they
run under Podman with `virtualisation.oci-containers`. Their images are
pinned by tag (or by digest when there's no matching tag), so updating one
means bumping the pin.

- **Podman needs `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run`.** Without it, rootful Podman puts
  network namespaces in `/run/user/0`, and every root SSH login (like a
  colmena deploy) mounts a fresh tmpfs over that folder. Podman then can't
  find the namespace to tear down, leaves the old port forward behind, and the
  port points at a dead container after the next restart.
- **Shelfarr binds port 80 as a normal user.** Docker allows that inside
  containers by default and Podman doesn't, so it gets
  `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=0`.
- **Calibre-Web-Automated imports whatever lands in the books-ingest folder**
  into the real library. Never run two of them against the same share.

## SABnzbd

The whole config comes from Nix and is written read-only on each start, so
changes made in the web UI don't stick. Credentials are in the `sabnzbd`
secret.

## Deluge

`core.conf` and the daemon's `auth` come from Nix. The web password and
labels are state in the data folder.

- The NixOS module creates the download folders with tmpfiles, which would
  `chmod` and `chown` them on the Unraid share. Those entries are forced
  empty so Nix never touches share permissions.
- Torrents are outgoing only. Deluge uses a random listening port and
  nothing is forwarded to it.

## Backups

Each app's data folder is backed up, minus logs, posters (`MediaCover` comes
back on a refresh) and the apps' own backup zips. The SQLite databases listed
in `homelab.arr.databases` are excluded as live files and dumped into a
`dumps/` folder next to them before each run.

To restore a database, follow the restore steps in
[docs/hetzner](../hetzner/README.md) for the app's folder. Then, with the app
stopped, copy the dump from `dumps/` over the database, delete its `-wal` and
`-shm` files, and start the app.
