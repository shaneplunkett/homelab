# Plex

NixOS LXC on Cube running `services.plex`, with the Intel iGPU passed through
for hardware transcoding. The container is `module "plex"` in
`terraform/cube-plex.tf` and the service is `modules/services/plex`.

## iGPU and media

Proxmox only lets `root@pam` set device passthrough and bind mounts, so the
`nixos-lxc` module's `devices` and `bind_mounts` apply them over SSH with
`pct set` and reboot the container. Only the render node is passed through,
owned by NixOS's `render` group (gid 303) inside the container, which the
`plex` user is in. Plex downloads its own VA-API drivers into `Drivers/`, so
the host needs nothing extra.

Media is the `unraid-media` storage pool bind-mounted at `/mnt/media`, the same
path the arr LXC uses, so library paths match.

## Remote access

The router's WAN port forward for 32400 is the only thing in the homelab
exposed directly to the internet, and it points at Plex's fixed DHCP address.
Shared users (family) reach the server through plex.tv, which knows it by the
machine identifier in `Preferences.xml`.

So anything that rebuilds or moves Plex has to keep both:

- **The MAC address.** `mac_address` in the Terraform keeps the UniFi
  reservation, so the IP and the port forward don't change.
- **`Preferences.xml`.** Without it Plex starts as a new, unclaimed server and
  every share has to be redone.

Check remote access from the host itself, where `mappingState="mapped"` means
plex.tv reached it from outside:

```sh
t=$(grep -o 'PlexOnlineToken="[^"]*' "/var/lib/plex/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml" | cut -d'"' -f2)
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:32400/myplex/account?X-Plex-Token=$t" | grep -o 'mapping[A-Za-z]*="[^"]*"'
```

## Backups

Only what can't be rebuilt is backed up: `Preferences.xml` and the databases
(watch history, libraries, settings). Metadata, thumbnails and the cache
come back on a library refresh.

The live databases are excluded. Before each run, `prepare` takes a
consistent `.backup` of each one into `/var/lib/plex/backup`, as the `plex`
user so it never leaves root-owned `-wal`/`-shm` files Plex can't open.

To restore, follow the restore steps in [docs/hetzner](../hetzner/README.md)
for `/var/lib/plex`, then with Plex stopped, copy each dump from `backup/`
over its file in `Plug-in Support/Databases/`, delete the matching `-wal` and
`-shm` files, and start Plex.
