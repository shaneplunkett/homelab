# Builder

NixOS LXC on PVE that runs the Forgejo runner for the forge. The container
is `module "builder"` in `terraform/pve-builder.tf`, and the service is
`modules/services/forgejo-runner`. It keeps no state worth backing up, so a
dead builder is rebuilt from code.

## How jobs run

A job with `runs-on: nix` runs straight on the host, not in a container, so
the Nix store stays warm between runs and a second build is mostly cached.
The host has Nix, git, colmena, and node for JavaScript actions like
`actions/checkout`. Anything else a job needs goes in `hostPackages`, or
comes from `nix shell` inside the job. Old store paths are collected weekly.

The builder also substitutes from the caches nix-config's machines trust.
The runner isn't a trusted user, so a flake can't add caches for itself, and
without them a desktop build compiles Hyprland and noctalia from source.

The host runs nix-ld, so binaries a job downloads for a generic Linux, like
the `ruff` that `uv sync` installs, run without patching. Without it they fail
with `Could not start dynamically linked executable`.

## Deploying

The deploy workflow runs `colmena apply --on @deploy-on-merge` on each push
to `main`. Its concurrency group queues deploys instead of cancelling them,
which is what Forgejo does by default for pushes. The builder's SSH key is an
authorised root key on every host, and its SSH config maps each host's name
to its LAN address from the hive, because the hosts don't use Tailscale's
DNS. It trusts each host by the key in `modules/agenix/host-keys.nix`.

The builder isn't in `deploy-on-merge`, so after merging a change to it, run
`colmena apply --on builder` by hand. Wait until that merge's deploy and
terraform runs have finished first. Switching the builder restarts the
runner, which kills whatever job it's running, and that run fails with
`RUN signal: terminated`.

## Updates

The update workflow runs weekly, or from the Actions tab with Run workflow.
It runs `nix flake update`, builds every host, pushes the result to
`update/flake-lock` as `forge-bot`, and opens a pull request that says
whether the build passed. It also builds every host from `main` first, so the
pull request can list each host's package changes from
`nix store diff-closures`, leaving out changes that are only in size. That
list can't show a source-only input like `vex-brain`, which has no version,
so the pull request also lists each moved input: a compare link for GitHub
inputs, and the new commits for inputs on the forge. Only then does it ask `metrokitten` to review,
which pings Discord, so the ping always comes with the build's result. If
last week's pull request is still open, it updates that one instead. Merging
it deploys like any other change.

`forge-bot` is a plain forge account with Write access to the repo. Its token
is `forge-bot-token`, in Bitwarden and agenix, and the runner loads it as a
credential. A pull request can't ask its own author for a review, which is why
the updates come from a bot and not from your account.

## Terraform

The terraform workflow runs when a pull request or a push to `main` touches
`terraform/`. On a pull request it plans and posts the plan as a comment,
which is where to check it. On `main` it plans again and applies, with no
further check, queued so two applies never overlap. Run workflow from the
Actions tab only plans, which is a quick way to look for drift.

State stays in Terraform Cloud. The builder reaches it with
`terraform-cloud-token`, a user API token in Bitwarden as `homelab_tfc_token`,
and the Proxmox and Hetzner tokens come from `homelab_pve_token` and
`homelab_hcloud_token`. All three are agenix secrets the runner loads as
credentials. The step that sets a container's devices and bind mounts runs
`pct` over SSH as `shane`, so the builder's key is in `shane`'s authorized
keys on both nodes.

## Renovate

Renovate runs on the builder every Sunday morning, as `forge-bot`, for the
pins a flake update doesn't touch: container images in Nix modules, flake
inputs pinned to a GitHub tag, the `npx` packages in the dev shell, and
Terraform providers. Each update is its own pull request asking
`metrokitten` to review, which pings Discord. The repo's rules are in
`renovate.json`, and its Nix manager is off, because the update workflow owns
`flake.lock`.

It finds repos by itself: any repo where `forge-bot` is a collaborator gets
an onboarding pull request first, unless it already has a `renovate.json`.
`renovate-github-token` is a read-only GitHub token, because GitHub refuses
to list tags and releases without one. To run it now:

```sh
ssh root@builder systemctl start renovate
```

## Registration

The forge and the builder share the `forgejo-runner-secret` secret, 40 hex
characters. `forgejo-runner-register` on the forge registers the runner with
it on every boot, which is idempotent. The first 16 characters identify the
runner, and its UUID in the Nix module is those characters' bytes as hex.

To replace the secret, from `modules/agenix`:

```sh
head -c 20 /dev/urandom | od -An -tx1 | tr -d ' \n' | rbw edit forgejo-runner-secret
printf '%s' "$(rbw get forgejo-runner-secret)" | agenix -e forgejo-runner-secret.age
printf '%s' "$(rbw get forgejo-runner-secret | head -c 16)" | od -An -tx1 | tr -d ' \n' \
  | sed -E 's/(.{8})(.{4})(.{4})(.{4})(.{12})/\1-\2-\3-\4-\5/'
```

The last command prints the new UUID for the module. Deploy the forge, then
the builder.

## Binary cache

Harmonia serves the builder's own Nix store at `cache.shaneplunkett.com`, so
anything a job builds can be downloaded by other machines instead of built
again. Nothing is pushed to it: building something is what puts it in the
cache. Paths are signed on the way out with `nix-cache-signing-key`, which is
in Bitwarden and agenix. A machine trusts the cache by its public half:

```sh
rbw get nix-cache-signing-key | nix key convert-secret-to-public
```

The store is collected weekly, so a build only stays in the cache while
something roots it. A job that wants its result kept builds with
`--out-link` into the runner's state directory, and replaces the link each
run so only the latest build is held. Full desktop and Mac closures are tens
of gigabytes each, so Nix also collects garbage by itself whenever free space
drops below `min-free`, and roots keep the latest builds safe from it.
`min-free` has to leave more room than the disk alert does, or Discord
hears about a full disk before Nix gets a chance to clear it.

The name only resolves through Blocky, so the cache is reachable on the LAN
and the tailnet and nowhere else.

## Darwin builds

The builder can't build for macOS, so it hands `aarch64-darwin` builds to
mini-server over SSH, and the results come back into its store and the
cache. That's how nix-config's Macs get built here. The Nix daemon makes the
connection as root with `builder-ssh-key`, logging in as `shane`. On
mini-server, nix-config pins that key to `nix-daemon --stdio`, so it can
build but can't open a shell.

mini-server's address is fixed in `darwin-builder.nix`, so it needs a DHCP
reservation like the LXCs. If darwin builds start failing to connect, check
that first.

## Fetching other repos

The forge needs a sign-in to see anything, and a job's own token only reaches
the repo it's running for. So flake inputs from other forge repos, like
`vex-brain`, come over SSH with the builder's own key, `builder-ssh-key`.
The runner loads it as a credential, and the host's SSH config uses it for
`forge`. It's added to each repo the builder fetches as a read-only deploy
key. To print the public half for a new repo:

```sh
ssh root@builder ssh-keygen -y -f /run/agenix/builder-ssh-key
```

## Gotchas

- **`rbw add` and `rbw edit` read from stdin** when it isn't a terminal, and
  only the first line becomes the password. A multi-line value like an SSH
  key can't live in Bitwarden that way, so `builder-ssh-key` exists only in
  agenix. If it's lost, make a new one and replace the deploy keys.
- **Registering without `--keep-labels` wipes the runner's labels.**
  `forgejo-runner-register` re-runs whenever Forgejo restarts, and the
  runner only declares its labels when it starts itself. Without the flag,
  every forge restart left the runner online with no labels, and jobs waited
  for a runner with `nix` that never came.
